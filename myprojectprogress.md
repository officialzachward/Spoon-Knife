I'd really like to make a web-based chat application for RPI students to rely on in terms of connecting with each other and meeting new students. In terms of repositories, I would likely have one mono-repository which contains directories for both, the front-end and the back-end.
I can see myself utilizing Angular and maybe Firebase for this project.
